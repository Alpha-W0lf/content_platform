i have a project idea for an app used to take youtube video ideas as input from the user. the app uses a workflow containing multiple modules that each creates assets that will be combined into final composed videos. the app will also automate posting the videos to youtube. this app will also be designed to manage multiple brands. each brand is focused on its own niche and posts videos to its own youtube channel. the app will include ai-driven self improvement based on user feedback, app performance monitoring, model performance, analytics/metrics from content platforms like youtube, etc. the app will utilize ai-driven self improvement as much as possible in all aspects of the app to get better and better at posting highly engaging content to youtube and other platforms.







desired stack for the frontend:
react, tanstack, next.js (with app router), typescript, tailwind css, and shadcn/ui


Okay, let's define a robust and ambitious Version 1.0, incorporating your goals for local AI-driven quality checks, a client-server architecture, a Next.js frontend, and initial platform integration (YouTube), while clearly separating out future enhancements. I'll also address how to make the approval/quality checks improve over time.






v0.0 Goals (Client-Server Foundation):

Establish a Client-Server Architecture: The core goal of v0.0 is to separate the backend (FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL) from the frontend (Next.js), and have them communicate exclusively over the network, even during local development.

Run the Backend on the M2 Max: The M2 Max will be your "server" for now. All backend components will run on it.

Run the Frontend on Either Machine: You should be able to run the Next.js frontend on either your M2 Max or your M2 Pro and have it connect to the backend on the M2 Max.

Simplified Functionality: The functionality will be extremely minimal â€“ essentially just proving that the communication works. We're focusing on the infrastructure, not the features.

Docker Compose for Backend: The backend services (API, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL) will be managed with Docker Compose on the M2 Max. This is crucial for portability.

Laying the groundwork for multi-machine use (single server, multiple clients): v0.0 needs to be designed so that it can be used from any computer on your network, not just the machine it's running on.

Foundational work for future capabilities: this structure will ensure it is easy to add more features, modules, and functionality as we build the app over time.

Task Queue (v0.0):
- Single Celery queue ("default") for initial client-server foundation
- Single comprehensive process_project task handling minimal workflow
- Focus on infrastructure and communication, not features
- Sets foundation for future task specialization

Project Status Management:
Primary Status Store (Database):
- projects.status: Enum("CREATED", "PROCESSING", "COMPLETED", "ERROR")
- Database is the source of truth for project status
- Frontend polls this status via API for updates

Optional Ephemeral Status (Redis):
- Can store current step details (e.g., "Generating script...") in Redis
- Must be treated as ephemeral (no persistence guarantees)
- Only for fast UI updates, not source of truth
- Key format: project:{project_id}:current_step
- TTL: 24 hours

Status Implementation:
- Avoid direct use of Celery task states
- API and application logic use ProjectStatus enum
- Map Celery states to ProjectStatus only in task layer
- Clear separation between Celery internals and application status

Error Handling:
process_project Task:
```python
@celery.task
def process_project(project_id: UUID):
    try:
        # Update project status
        update_project_status(project_id, "PROCESSING")
        
        # Create project record
        try:
            project = create_project_record(project_id)
        except Exception as e:
            log_error("Project creation failed", e, project_id)
            raise
            
        # Set initial status
        try:
            update_project_status(project_id, "CREATED")
        except Exception as e:
            log_error("Status update failed", e, project_id)
            raise
            
        # Success - update final status
        update_project_status(project_id, "COMPLETED")
        
    except Exception:
        # Any unhandled exception updates status to ERROR
        update_project_status(project_id, "ERROR")
        raise  # Re-raise to ensure Celery marks task as failed
```

Celery Configuration (v0.0):
```python
CELERY_CONFIG = {
    'broker_url': 'redis://redis:6379/0',
    'result_backend': 'redis://redis:6379/0',
    'task_serializer': 'json',
    'result_serializer': 'json',
    'accept_content': ['json'],
    'task_track_started': True,
    'task_always_eager': False,
    'task_time_limit': 3600,  # 1 hour
    'task_soft_time_limit': 3300,  # 55 minutes
    'worker_max_tasks_per_child': 10,
    'worker_prefetch_multiplier': 1
}
```

v0.0 Deliverables:

Working FastAPI Backend (Dockerized):

A single POST /projects endpoint that:
- Uses Pydantic model for request validation:
  ```python
  class CreateProjectRequest(BaseModel):
      topic: str
      notes: Optional[str] = None
  ```
- Handles validation errors with proper HTTP 422 responses
- Implements proper async/await patterns
- Returns JSON responses with consistent structure
- Uses dependency injection for database access

Generates a UUID for the project ID.

Creates a basic Project record in the database (just id, name, status = "CREATED", created_at, and topic).

Doesn't start any Celery tasks yet.

Returns the project_id.

Error Handling:
- Uses FastAPI's built-in exception handlers
- Returns structured error responses (JSON) with detailed error codes and messages
- Uses HTTPException with appropriate status codes
- Implements custom exception handlers for specific error types
- Includes request_id in all responses for tracing
- Includes correlation_id for tracking requests across services
- Stack traces included in dev mode responses
- Detailed logging of all errors to stdout (JSON format)
- Error context includes request ID, timestamp, and full request details
- Integration with Glitchtip for error tracking
- All database errors are caught and logged with full context
- All HTTP 500 errors trigger alerts

A GET /projects/{project_id}/status endpoint that:

Retrieves the Project record from the database.

Returns the project's status (initially, this will always be "CREATED").

A GET /health endpoint (you already have this).

Runs within a Docker container, managed by Docker Compose.

Working Celery Worker (Dockerized):

A Celery worker, also running in a Docker container.

For now, it doesn't need to actually do anything. The important thing is that it connects to Redis and is ready to receive tasks.

Error Handling:
- Detailed task failure logging (JSON format)
- Failed tasks are logged with full stack traces and context
- Task retry policies with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed tasks
- Integration with Glitchtip for error tracking
- All errors viewable in Grafana dashboards
- Alerts on task failure patterns

Working Redis and PostgreSQL (Dockerized):

These are already in your docker-compose.yml.

Basic Next.js Frontend:

A single page.

A text input field for the topic.

A "Create Project" button.

When the button is clicked:

It makes a POST request to the /projects endpoint on the backend (running on the M2 Max).

It displays the returned project_id.

A "Check Status" button.

When clicked, it makes a GET request to /projects/{project_id}/status.

It displays the returned status.

No real-time updates, no WebSockets. Just basic request/response.

Error Handling:
- Detailed error boundaries with technical context
- Network error handling with retry logic
- Error states shown with technical details
- Integration with Glitchtip for client-side error tracking
- Development tools enabled in development mode
- Network request/response logging in developer tools

Version 0.1, MVP:

Video Generation Tool - Version 0.1 (MVP) Summary

Objective:

To create a self-hosted web application that automates the core video creation process: from topic input to a downloaded HeyGen AI avatar video, laying a robust and extensible foundation for future development.

User Flow:

Topic Input: User enters a video topic (text string) via a simple web form. (Optional notes are not included in v0.1 to minimize scope).

Automated Script Generation & Tagging:

The system sends the topic to the Gemini Pro API (or a comparable LLM API) with a carefully crafted prompt.

This prompt instructs the LLM to:

Generate a script suitable for a brief (approximately 4-5 minute) explainer video. Note: we have a hard max length of 5:00 imposed by HeyGen, so we need to ensure the script does not cause the AI avatar video from HeyGen to go even a second over 5:00.

Format the script using specific tags: [topic], [title], [alt title], [thumbnail], [narration], [slide], [image], [remotion] [manim], and [length].

It uses the guidelines from the INSTRUCTIONS brief.txt file to prompt for the script and to add the tags.

The system receives the tagged script from the API.

Script Processing:

The system parses the tagged script.

The system extracts the content within each tag type into separate files:

narration.txt: Contains all [narration] tagged items.

slides.txt: Contains all [slide] tagged items.

images.txt: Contains all [image] tagged items.

remotion.txt: Contains all [remotion] tagged items.

manim.txt: Contains all [manim] tagged items.

Other tags like the thumbnail tag are also processed.

The system saves the alt title of the video as the name of the project.

Script Processing (Gemini Pro API):

Two-Step Process: Using the API for both generation and tagging is a good simplification for v0.1.

Prompt Engineering: This is critical. Spend time crafting and refining your prompts. The quality of your output depends entirely on this.

Prompt Versioning: Keep different versions of your prompts (e.g., in separate files) so you can track which prompts work best.

Prompt Instructions: Your prompt to the API must include very precise instructions. You must provide the guidelines and details from the INSTRUCTIONS brief.txt file.

Error Handling: Handle API errors (timeouts, rate limits, invalid responses) gracefully.

HeyGen Video Creation:

The system uses a Playwright-based automation module to interact with the HeyGen website.

It logs in to HeyGen (using credentials from environment variables).

It creates a new video, using the extracted narration text.

It selects a default avatar and voice (configurable via environment variables or a simple config file â€“ not in the UI for v0.1).

It submits the video for generation.

It waits for the video generation to complete.

It downloads the generated video.

AI Avatar Generation (HeyGen): This module uses Playwright (configured for reliability and robustness) to control a web browser to navigate to the HeyGen website and perform the necessary actions to generate an avatar video based on the [narration][/narration] prompts extracted from the script.

Implementation Details:
- Headless Mode: Runs in headless mode (headless=True) for normal operation
- Debug Mode: Can switch to headful mode (headless=False) for debugging and development
- Error Handling:
  - Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Screenshot capture on failure for debugging
  - Detailed error logging with context
  - Recovery procedures for common failure scenarios
  - Session management and automatic re-authentication

Once the avatar video is ready, it will be downloaded from HeyGen. This is a key v0.1 feature.

Status Display: The user sees a simple status message on the web page, indicating the progress (e.g., "Generating script...", "Creating HeyGen video...", "Downloading video...", "Completed!"). No detailed progress bars or per-asset status in v0.1.

Download Link: A link to download the generated video is displayed.

Technical Implementation:

Configuration (.env): Use environment variables for API keys, database URLs, etc.

Logging: Use structured logging (JSON format) from the beginning. This will make it much easier to analyze logs later. You've got a good start on this.

Containerization: make sure the docker containers and services are well defined and implemented.

Frontend: Next.js (single page):

Text input field for the topic.

"Generate" button.

Status display (simple text).

Download link.

Error Handling:
- React error boundaries with full technical context
- Network request/response logging in developer tools
- Integration with browser devtools for debugging

Error Handling:
- Transaction rollback logging
- Deadlock detection and logging
- Connection pool error tracking
- Query timeout monitoring
- Detailed error states in metrics
- Integration with Grafana for visualization
- Alert rules for database errors

Single queue: default.

Single task: process_project.

Error Handling:
- Detailed task failure logging
- Dead letter queues for failed tasks
- Retry policies with backoff
- Task state tracking in Redis
- Error correlation with logs
- Integration with Glitchtip
- Prometheus metrics for task errors
- Custom error dashboards in Grafana

process_project Task:

Calls Gemini Pro API to generate the initial script.

Calls Gemini Pro API to add the tags.

Parses the tagged script.

Creates separate files for narration, slides, etc.

Calls the HeyGenAutomation module (using Playwright).

Downloads the video.

Updates the project status in the database.

HeyGen Automation: Playwright-based automation of the HeyGen website.

Error Handling:
- Browser error logging
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Network request logging
- Element interaction errors
- Page state capture on error
- Integration with Glitchtip
- Retry logic for flaky operations

- Detailed error messages for missing/invalid config
- Secrets validation without logging
- Integration with Glitchtip
- Environment comparison tools
- Configuration drift detection
- Alert rules for config issues

Monitoring: Minimal Prometheus metrics (project creation count, task success/failure, task duration). No Grafana dashboards for v0.1. Focus on logging.

Testing: Integration tests that go from topic input to downloaded video. Minimal unit tests.

Docker: Use docker compose file to run all the services: Redis and PostgreSQL. Use Dockerfile.api for the backend.

Key Design Decisions and Justifications:

External API for Script Generation and Tagging (v0.1): This significantly simplifies the MVP. You're leveraging the power of a large language model without having to manage it yourself. This is a good choice for getting a working prototype quickly.

Playwright for HeyGen Automation: More robust and maintainable than Selenium. A good foundation for future automation.

Simplified Status: Just "CREATED," "PROCESSING," "COMPLETED," or "ERROR" for the project status. No per-asset status, no progress bars.

No Manual Approval: No asset approval workflow in v0.1. The generated video is the final output.

No Local AI Models: No local image generation, no local video generation, no local quality assessment models. This drastically reduces complexity.

Single Queue: Simplifies task routing for the MVP.

Minimal UI: Focus on the core functionality.

Foundational Elements (for Future Extensibility):

Modular Structure: The code is organized into modules (api, core, ml, platforms, etc.) that can be extended later.

Database Schema: The Project and Asset models are in place, providing a foundation for tracking assets and their metadata.

Task Queue: Celery is set up, allowing for asynchronous processing and future scaling.

API: The FastAPI backend provides a clear API for the frontend to interact with.

Configuration: Environment variables and configuration files are used for settings.

Logging: Consistent logging is in place.

Playwright: This is a better option than Selenium.

This MVP focuses on the core value proposition: automated video creation from a topic. It deliberately avoids all the "nice-to-have" features to get to a working system as quickly as possible. It's designed to be built upon, not to be perfect. The infrastructure is designed with future capabilities in mind.



MVP Notes

i would like to keep referring to the full ambitious planned version as version 1. we can also define a simpler, easier mvp. perhaps calling it version 0.1. is this reasonable? also, after fully completing the planning stage that you laid out, what if we consider something like the following the mvp:

lay the foundation for all of the infrastructure, modules, functionality, etc for version 1 and future versions so that we can iteratively add modules/features over time. the mvp will only focus on taking a video idea/topic from the user with optional notes, converting it into a fully formatted script, and then using the heygen browser automation module to use heygen to create the ai avatar video and download it from heygen once it is done generating.

after this mvp is created, tested, and deployed, we can iterate on it to add all of the full functionality we have been discussing. more modules , basic (then advanced)  monitoring/analytics , youtube posting automation, automated learning and improvement, other advanced functionality, etc.

i want to make sure that this mvp has a module called 'script creation' that uses an api for an ai model like gemini 2.0 pro exp to create a high quality script from the topic the user inputs. i also want to make sure the next module 'script processing' uses the same api to add tags for title, length, narration, slides, images, etc. this module then aggregates all the tags (and contents) of each type into their own files. all narration tags, all script tags, etc. this module conducts any other necessary processing as well. the third module 'heygen automation' handles the browser automation to use heygen to create and download the ai avatar video. this will be considered the mvp. we will build a basic frontend with the next.js stack we have already defined. we will build all infrastructure, database, and services with strong focus on laying the foundation for future modules and advanced functionality to come. it is critical that this simplified mvp is designed and built with the expectation of significant future development for more features, complexity, monitoring, and advanced ai capabilities as we have been planning for. this means we are building in a way that will not require refactoring, conflicts, or heavy changes as we build more features into the app. this is one of the key focuses for the mvp. not just the simplified workflow we described.

Automated Workflow:

Topic Input: User provides a topic/idea (text).

AI Script Generation: An LLM generates a script tailored for the target platform (YouTube, etc.) and brand, including narration, slide content, and image prompts. This is a fine-tuned LLM, or a very well-prompted external API.

AI Asset Generation:

Narration: AI Text-to-Speech (TTS) or AI Avatar (HeyGen) generates narration audio.

Slides: AI generates slide images based on script content (rule-based or AI-generated).

Images/B-Roll: AI generates images/short video clips based on prompts from the script (Stable Diffusion + AnimateDiff, or similar).

Video Composition: Combines narration, slides, images, and video clips into a final video.

Automated Publishing: Uploads the finished video to YouTube (v1.0), with title, description, and tags (generated by the script processor).

AI-Driven Quality Control:

Automated Checks: Rule-based checks (resolution, duration, etc.) and AI-powered checks (image quality, relevance to script, style consistency).

Automated quality scores.

YouTube analytics (views, likes, comments, watch time, etc.).

Resource utilization metrics.

All generated scripts.

All prompts to the external API for script generation and tagging.

Model Fine-tuning: The collected data is used to fine-tune the local AI models (image quality assessment, script generation, etc.).

Prompt Optimization: The system analyzes which prompts produce the best results (highest quality, best engagement) and adjusts its prompting strategy accordingly.

Automated A/B Testing: (Potentially) The system can run A/B tests on different script generation prompts, model versions, or encoding settings to optimize performance.

Multi-Brand Support (Foundational):

The system is designed to handle multiple "brands," each with its own:

Style guidelines (tone, visual style, etc.).

Target audience.

YouTube channel.

(Potentially) Separate fine-tuned models.

Technical Monitoring:

Comprehensive Metrics: Detailed metrics on all aspects of the system (resource usage, task queue status, processing times, error rates, quality scores, etc.).

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, (potentially Glitchtip and Jaeger)

Automation: Playwright (for HeyGen interaction)

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

Authentication: Clerk








Version 1.0: Intelligent, Self-Hosted Video Generation Platform

Core Philosophy: Version 1.0 is a platform that has the foundations for learning and improvement. It's a single, self-hosted system that can be controlled remotely, leverages local AI for key tasks, and sets the stage for future expansion.

Key Features (v1.0):

Foundational support for future feature: multiple brands where each brand has its own configuration and style.

Foundational support for future feature: 16:9 horizontal long videos and 9:16 vertical short videos (15-60 seconds).

Support for sound effects, background music, and more audio features. need to think about how to implement this. One or more modules.

Support for transitions, animations, and more video features. need to think about how to implement this. Possibly one or more modules. Can this be handled by video composition module?

Client-Server Architecture:

Backend: FastAPI server running on your M2 Max. Handles all project management, task queuing, asset storage, database interactions, and communication with local AI models.

Frontend: Next.js web application. This is a complete replacement for the Electron UI. The Next.js app runs in a browser and communicates with the FastAPI backend via API calls.

Task Queue: Celery and Redis for asynchronous task management.

Database: PostgreSQL for storing project data, asset metadata, feedback, and (eventually) model training data.

Self-Hosted: All components (backend, frontend, database, task queue) run on your M2 Max. No reliance on external cloud services for core functionality. The one exception is the module that handles HeyGen automation. This module will use browser automation to control a web browser to navigate to the HeyGen website and perform the necessary actions to generate an avatar video.

Project Management:

Project Creation: Via the Next.js UI, user uploads a video topic or idea along with optional additional information or notes.

Project Listing: UI shows a list of all projects, with their status (e.g., "Processing Script," "Generating Slides," "Generating Avatar," "Generating Images," "Composing Video," "Ready for Review," "Published," "Error").

Project Details: UI shows detailed project information, including progress, individual asset status, and any errors.

Automated Video Generation Pipeline:

The user will submit a topic or idea for a video along with optional additional information or notes.

Script Creation: This module will use an LLM to think about the topic, research the topic, and create a script. This script creation will be specialized in creating highly engaging scripts for informative and entertaining youtube videos. Tactics and strategies will need to be defined that will be implemented in this module. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Script Processing: This module will process the initial script and add additional fields to the script marked by tags. [title][/title], [alt_title][/alt_title], [thumbnail][/thumbnail], [description][/description], [length][/length] (character count, word count, estimated time to read), [narration][/narration] (each sentence will be marked with a [narration][/narration] tag), [slide][/slide] (between the opening and closing [slide][/slide] tags is a slide prompt in markdown format), [image][/image] (between the opening and closing [image][/image] tags is an image prompt), [remotion][/remotion] (between the opening and closing [remotion][/remotion] tags is a remotion prompt), [manim][/manim] (between the opening and closing [manim][/manim] tags is a manim prompt), etc. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Script Segregation: This module will segregate the script into different files based on aggregating all tags of each type. Each file will be used by its corresponding module according to the tags. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Thumbnail Generation: This module will generate a thumbnail for the video based on the [thumbnail][/thumbnail] prompt extracted from the script. This is a key v1.0 feature.

AI Avatar Generation (HeyGen): This module uses browser automation to control a web browser to navigate to the HeyGen website and perform the necessary actions to generate an avatar video based on the [narration][/narration] prompts extracted from the script. Once the avatar video is ready, it will be downloaded from HeyGen. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Slide Generation: Generates slide images based on the [slide][/slide] prompts extracted from the script, using defined templates (we already have templates, but will need to review them). This is a key v1.0 feature.

Image Generation (Local Model): Uses a local text to image generation model for generating images based on [image][/image] prompts extracted from the script. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Clip Generation (Local image to video Model): Uses a local image to video generation model for generating videos based on images generated by the image generation module. This is a key v1.0 feature.

React Remotion: Uses React Remotion to generate remotion clips based on the [remotion][/remotion] prompts extracted from the script. This is a key v1.0 feature. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Manim: Uses Manim to generate animations based on the [manim][/manim] prompts extracted from the script. This is a key v1.0 feature.

Video Composition: Combines narration, slides, and images into a final video (using MoviePy, FFmpeg, and/or similar tools). This is a key v1.0 feature.

Automated Quality Checks and Approvals (Local AI):

Rule-Based Checks: Your existing QualityChecker, ClipValidator, and SlideValidator are used for basic checks (resolution, duration, etc.).

ML-Based Checks: Integrate local AI models (e.g., a smaller VLM like a variant of LLaVA, or a specialized image quality assessment model) to perform more sophisticated checks:

Image Quality: Assess blurriness, aesthetics, composition, and relevance to the prompt.

Slide Quality: Check text readability, contrast, layout, and relevance to the narration.

Clip Quality: Assess motion smoothness, visual artifacts, and relevance to the generated images.

Relevance: Use a model (like CLIP) to verify the relationship between image/slide and the corresponding script section.

Automated Decisions:

Assets that pass all checks with high confidence are automatically approved.

Assets that fail critical checks are automatically rejected.

Assets with borderline results or low confidence are flagged for manual review.

Feedback Storage: All check results (rule-based and ML-based), along with confidence scores, are stored in the feedback_records table, linked to the specific asset and project. This is crucial for future model training.

Human-in-the-Loop Review:

The Next.js UI allows manual review of flagged assets and a random sample of all assets. This is crucial for ongoing quality control and model improvement.

The UI displays the results of automated checks (rule-based and ML-based), including confidence scores.

Users can:

Approve assets.

Reject assets (with a reason, using a controlled vocabulary of reasons - this is important for analysis). Free-form text is allowed in addition to the structured reason.

Provide additional feedback (tags, comments). This is stored in the feedback_records table.

Approval decisions and feedback are stored, linked to the specific asset_id and project_id.

YouTube Publishing (Basic):

Automated upload to YouTube, using the YouTube Data API.

Basic metadata support (title, description, tags).

No scheduling (this is deferred).

Authentication via Clerk.

Upload progress display in the UI.

Task Management:

Task prioritization (high, normal, low).

Machine Registry (Simplified for v1.0):

Your M2 Max registers itself on startup.

Dynamic machine discovery when client and server are on the same network for v1.0. remote access on different networks will be a future feature.

Stores machine capabilities (CPU, GPU, memory) in Redis.

The Task Router uses this information (even though it's only one machine).

Authentication (Clerk):

The FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend are protected by Clerk authentication.

API endpoints require valid authentication.

User information (e.g., user ID) is stored with feedback data.

Comprehensive Logging: Structured logging (JSON format) for all operations, including timestamps, task IDs, project IDs, asset IDs, and relevant context.

Testing:

Unit Tests: For individual functions and classes.

Integration Tests: For interactions between components (e.g., API and database, Celery tasks and database).

E2E Tests: For the entire workflow, from script upload to video generation and upload. This is critical for v1.0.

Performance Test Harness: you should build a harness to use for testing.

Monitoring (Core User Interface):

Purpose: Provide you, the user/developer, with detailed, real-time insights into the application's performance, resource usage, and quality metrics. This is a key tool for debugging, optimization, and understanding the behavior of your system. It is not intended as a polished, end-user dashboard (at least not for v1.0) but rather as a comprehensive technical interface for your use.

Continued Brainstorming:

i want to keep thinking about the project vision and how to implement it. this includes more thought about version 1 and exactly how it will work. also, future features. the version 1 definition in this file is great and this brainstorming is intended to continue thinking about the project. the overall purpose of the project is to automate video creation from start to finish. i want to go from a video idea or topic to a final video. the tool will take care of everything all the way to uploading to youtube (version 1). automated posting to other platforms will be a future feature addition. also,the tool will be able to generate thumbnails, descriptions, tags, and other metadata to make the video more engaging. everything needed to post the video to the various platforms will be handled by the tool.

in addition, the tool needs to handle content creation for multiple brands. each brand is focused on a specific niche. each brand will have its own configuration and style. ideally the tool will be intelligent enough to automatically figure this out without detailed, manual intervention or configuration. each brand will have its own accounts on youtube and other platforms. the tool will need to be able to handle all of this.

also, the tool will use local ai models for quality checks and approvals and will also flag assets that need to be reviewed by a human. assets that the models are unsure of as well as a random sample of assets will be flagged for review. this human (user) feedback as well as all available analytics and metrics from platforms like youtube, tiktok, instagram, etc. will be used to improve the models and the overall video creation process over time. the ai models will be able to use the available analytics and metrics to improve the video creation process over time.

the tool will use server-client architecture so that all intensive tasks can be handled by the server computer. the server computer will be whatever is the most powerful computer in my machine registry. currently, my m2 max is the most powerful computer. i have plans to add more powerful computers to the machine registry in the future. the tool needs to be accessible from any of my other computers in the machine registry. in version 1, the tool must work when the server and client machines are on the same network and route a majority of the tasks to the server computer. for a future feature, the tool must also work when the server and client machines are on different networks so that i have the ability to travel anywhere in the world and have remote access to my tool from a client computer and still utilize my server computer to run intensive tasks. also, another future feature will be more advanced distributed processing so that the tool can use multiple machines to process tasks in parallel. this way all of the available machines in my machine registry can be utilized to their fullest extent. another future feature will be wake on lan so that the server computer can be turned on and off without having to manually start it. another future feature will be a mobile app so that i can access the tool from my phone.

another note, its probably a good idea to organize the codebase file structure into clear frontend and backend directories within the same repo. considering the transition to the server-client architecture, we should plan to have a frontend using react, tanstack, next.js (with app router), typescript, tailwind css, and shadcn/ui. currently, the frontend uses electron and we will need to transition to next.js. also, even though a lot of code was written for the current electron implementation, the user interface was not carefully thought out. we should plan to transition to a next.js frontend and also think a lot more about how the frontend/interface needs to be designed. it is important to understand that we expect to redesign the frontend. we do not need to be overly worried about discarding the current electron implementation since not much effort and thought was put into it.

as we think more about the primary role of the user and the overall purpose of the tool, we should plan the interface to be as user-friendly as possible and really focus on the core user experience and the core vision for the entire project. the ambition of the project is a fully automated video creation tool that takes care of everything from start to finish. also, this tool is designed to be used by one user. that user is also the developer who is building the tool.considering this, the user's role is to monitor the entire tool and continuously improve it. he should have the ability to see the big picture as well as the details of each part of the entire tool and everything in between. the user should also be able to see performance metrics and analytics for each brand, each video, each platform, etc. one of the key purposes of the tool along with monitoring is to provide the user with the ability to conduct quality checks and approvals and to continuously improve the tool over time. the interface needs to be designed to support the core vision of the project.

because monitoring is a very important part of the user experience, we are using grafana and prometheus. we need to also incorporate tools like loki, promtail, and glitchtip to help with monitoring. also jaeger for distributed tracing.

another important consideration is that the tool is designed to be continuously improved over time. this means that modules and ai models need to be designed to be easily replaceable and updatable. the tool should be able to use different modules and ai models for different brands and different platforms and it needs to be designed to expect frequent updates and experimentation with different modules and ai models. future feature additions should even consider automatically scanning for newly released modules and ai models and automatically conduction testing and experimentation with the new modules and ai models. based on the results of the testing and experimentation, the tool should be able to automatically update the modules and ai models that are being used.

the tool should use clerk for authentication.

the tool needs to be designed for continuous development and improvement. this includes the ability to easily update the codebase as well as the ability to easily update the ai models and modules. we should plan for modularity and extensibility. we should always adhere to best practices and design patterns. we should always think about graceful, elegant, efficient, simple, well organized, and scalable design as much as possible.

the tool should be designed to use local ai models in version 1. a future feature addition will be the option to use api based ai models as well with easy evaluation and switching between various local and api based ai models.
