we need to significantly simplify and consolidate the documentation. remove conflicting, older information and consolidate it into a single, up to date source.

do i need to think more about docker implementation?

do i need to think more about the server-client architecture?

do i need to think more about the frontend?

do i need to think more about the backend?

do we need to think more about the database?

do we need to think more about virtual environments?

what areas of the project need more thought?

how do i begin thinking about user interaction, interface, and frontend? this area still seems unclear to me.

what about using a swipe interface to simply approve or reject each asset for review in the mobile app? along with back and skip buttons. is a boolean value for approval/rejection enough to improve the tool over time?

version 1 will not include a mobile app. a mobile app will be a future feature. version 1 will only have a web app. this web app should provide a simple approval/rejection interface for each asset. boolean approval/rejection along with back and skip buttons.

how do i think about how the tool will improve itself over time? this area still seems unclear to me.

how should i think about how approval/feedback data affects each brand? does data need to be isolated for each brand or can it be aggregated? what about model training over time? does model training need to be isolated for each brand? can it be aggregated?

how many different models do i need to implement? does each brand and each asset type need its own model or can model usage be generalized?

at what point am i done with planning? when i can i plan to continue development based on the updated plan?

how do i think about the data that will be used to train the models?

how much should i learn about react, next.js, typescript, tailwind css, and shadcn/ui before i start development? keep in mind that i will be using an ai coding assistant to help me with development.

how much should i learn about each of the tools and technologies that will be used in the project before i start development? keep in mind that i will be using an ai coding assistant to help me with development.

what specific areas and decisions will require my direct input and involvement? what areas can i delegate to the ai coding assistant?

are there any gaps or missing pieces in the development plan or version 1 definition or future work?

how should i structure the development process and plan? what are the key milestones and deliverables? what are the dependencies between milestones and deliverables? what is the sequence of development?

how should i plan for testing? should i plan to conduct testing alongside development?

what is the definition of version 1? what will be considered future work to be completed after version 1?

i need to work with an ai llm to help think through these questions and also identify more areas that i need to consider.
