user prompt:
i am currently working on getting the docker frontend build to work correctly. the frontend build seems to work fine locally, but when attempting with docker, it is having trouble. seems like something to do with a typescript problem in this file: src/frontend/app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx

i have been struggling with this for over a day. trying all kinds of troubleshooting. i believe i have covered all the usual troubleshooting steps, but am still having the same trouble. please help me continue troubleshooting. assume the role of a principal software engineer who is very familiar with this type of issue.

here are some of the logs:

give me a structured guide that i can follow to troubleshoot and debug.

response:
Okay, let's break down this TypeScript + Next.js + Docker build issue systematically. You've done a good job providing the error message and relevant files. The key error is:

app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx
Type error: Type 'PageProps' does not satisfy the constraint 'import("/app/.next/types/app/projects/[projectId]/page").PageProps'.
  Types of property 'params' are incompatible.
    Type '{ projectId: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.

This error tells us precisely where the problem lies: the type definition of PageProps in your src/frontend/app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx file is incorrect. It's expecting params to be an object with a projectId property that is a string. However, Next.js's type system (during the build process within Docker) is inferring that params should be a Promise<any>. This mismatch is causing the build to fail. The reason the Next.js build is behaving differently inside the Docker container vs locally is likely due to subtle differences in the environment, specifically around how types are inferred, and the .next directory contents.

Here's a structured troubleshooting guide:

1. Verify Fundamental Assumptions and Eliminate Simple Errors:

File Paths: Double-check very carefully that all file paths in your import statements within page.tsx and related components (like api.ts) are absolutely correct, relative to the file they're in. A small typo here can cause bizarre type errors. Since you're in src/frontend/app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx, imports should look like:

import { projectsApi } from "../../../lib/api"; // Correct relative import
import { ThemeToggle } from "../../../components/theme-toggle"; // Correct relative import
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

projectId Spelling: Ensure that projectId is consistently spelled (lowercase "p", camelCase) everywhere it's used: in the file name ([projectId]), in the PageProps interface, and when accessing params.projectId.

Clean Build: Sometimes, stale build artifacts can cause issues. Run these commands in your src/frontend directory locally (not inside the container yet):

rm -rf .next
npm run build
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

If this fails locally, you've isolated the problem to your code, not Docker.

Project Type Consistency: Make absolutely certain that the Project interface in src/frontend/types/index.d.ts exactly matches the schema you're getting from your backend. If there's any discrepancy (e.g., a missing field, a different type for a field), it can cause the error you're seeing. If you've changed your backend schema, update the frontend type.

api.ts Return Types: In src/frontend/lib/api.ts, the return types of your functions (create, getStatus, getProject) are crucial. Ensure these are correctly typed, and using the interfaces from /types. For example, use ProjectSchema where appropriate.

2. Focus on page.tsx and Type Definitions:

PageProps Interface (Corrected): This is the most likely source of the error. The params property should be an object with a projectId that is a string. Your code already has this correct, but double-check it:

// src/frontend/app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx
interface PageProps {
    params: {
        projectId: string;
    };
    searchParams?: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined };
}
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

The key here is that projectId must be a string, not a Promise<string> or anything else.

async and await: Ensure that you are using async and await correctly when fetching data.

Remove and Re-Add: As a troubleshooting step, try temporarily removing the explicit type annotation : PageProps from your component:

// TEMPORARILY remove : PageProps
export default async function ProjectPage( { params, searchParams } ) {
    // ... rest of your component
}
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

Then, hover over params within VS Code. What type does VS Code infer? If it's not { projectId: string; }, then there's a problem with how you're using params or with how Next.js is interpreting your route. Put the type annotation back after checking.

Explicit Type Assertions (as a last resort): If you're absolutely certain that params.projectId will be a string, you could temporarily use a type assertion to force TypeScript to treat it as a string:

const projectId = params.projectId as string;
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

Important: This is a diagnostic step, not a permanent solution. If this "fixes" the build, it means you're masking a deeper type issue, and you need to figure out why TypeScript isn't inferring the correct type.

3. Isolate the Problem with Minimal Code:

Create a Minimal page.tsx: To eliminate potential issues with other parts of your component, create a very minimal version of page.tsx:

interface PageProps {
    params: {
        projectId: string;
    };
}

export default async function ProjectPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Project ID: {params.projectId}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

If this minimal version builds correctly, then the problem lies in the other parts of your original page.tsx (e.g., the useEffect hook, the API calls, or the state management). Gradually add back your original code, testing the build after each addition, until you isolate the problematic section.

4. Examine Docker-Specific Issues:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Ensure that NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correctly set in your .env.local file and that this environment variable is being correctly passed to the Docker container during the build process. Your Dockerfile.frontend looks correct in this regard, but double-check that the .env.local values are what you expect. During development, it should probably be http://api:8000 inside the container, and http://<your_m2_max_ip>:8000 from the host.

Network Configuration: Make sure your Next.js rewrites in next.config.js file are set up properly.

Dockerfile.frontend Review the updated Dockerfile.frontend for best practices.

Docker Build Context: The build context for your frontend is .. Make sure that your .dockerignore file (if you have one) is not excluding any necessary files or directories (like src/frontend).

Caching Issues: Docker uses caching extensively. Sometimes, a stale cache can cause unexpected build failures. Try rebuilding with the --no-cache flag:

docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

5. Debugging Within the Container:

Shell into the Running Container: If the build succeeds but the application doesn't work as expected, you can shell into the running container:

docker-compose run frontend sh
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Once inside, you can:

Check environment variables: echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

Inspect files: ls -l src/frontend/app/projects/[projectId]

Try running commands manually: npm run build (although this might not work exactly the same way as during the initial build)

Interactive Debugging (More Advanced): For more complex debugging, you can set up interactive debugging within the container. This usually involves installing debugging tools and configuring your IDE to connect to the running container. This is beyond the scope of this immediate troubleshooting, but it's a good technique to learn.

Troubleshooting Steps (Prioritized):

Verify PageProps Interface: Double, triple-check the PageProps interface in page.tsx. This is the most likely culprit, based on the error message.

Minimal page.tsx: Create the minimal version of page.tsx to isolate the issue.

Clean Local Build: rm -rf .next && npm run build locally to rule out stale artifacts.

Check Imports: Verify all file paths in your import statements are correct.

Type Consistency (Project): Ensure your Project interface is consistent across frontend and backend.

Hover for Types: Use VS Code's type hinting (hover over variables) to understand what types are being inferred.

Dockerfile Review: Review the changes that were made in the Dockerfile.frontend.

Docker Build --no-cache: Rebuild the frontend image with --no-cache to rule out caching issues.

Shell into Container (if build succeeds): Check environment variables and file paths.

By following these steps systematically, you should be able to pinpoint the root cause of the TypeScript error and get your Docker build working correctly. Remember to focus on isolating the problem and verifying your assumptions at each step. Good luck!
