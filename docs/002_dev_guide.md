Okay, let's assess the current state and chart a course for robust, incremental progress. I'll focus on a manageable set of next steps, assuming you're working with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

make sure that as we work, we are very mindful to update our pogress and keep this section up to date.

make sure to carefully review our codebase and our file structure before making changes. we want to make sure to be targeted and careful as we work. we need to always use best practices. keep code clean, robust, modular, extensible, and maintainable.

Project Assessment (Current State - v0.0 Foundation)

Strengths:

You have a well-defined project structure, separating frontend and backend concerns.

Docker Compose is used for containerization, which is excellent for consistency and deployment.

FastAPI (backend) and Next.js (frontend) are solid choices for a modern web application.

Basic API endpoints (/projects, /health) are defined.

Database models (Project, Asset) are set up with SQLAlchemy.

Alembic for database migrations is initialized.

Celery is integrated for asynchronous tasks.

Basic type hinting is used (this is very good - keep it up!).

Clerk is integrated for authentication, which is excellent for security and saving development time.

Shadcn/ui is integrated.

Basic CORS configuration.

Areas for Immediate Improvement/Focus:

Testing: The testing setup is minimal. We need to solidify this immediately to ensure a stable base.

Error Handling: While basic HTTPException is used, we need comprehensive error handling, especially around database interactions and external API calls (which will come soon).

Frontend - Backend Communication: The Next.js frontend can now talk to the backend!

Logging: Basic logging is present, but we need to make it structured (JSON) for easier analysis.

Configuration: Using Pydantic Settings is good. We need to ensure all relevant configurations (especially URLs) are correctly pulled from environment variables in both development (local) and within the Docker containers.

Celery Configuration: The celeryconfig.py needs to use settings from config.py to make it truly configurable, and a test task exists.

Asynchronous Patterns: Consistent use of async/await is crucial. We need to review to make absolutely sure it's being used correctly everywhere.

Relationship in DB Model: The relationship defined in project.py and asset.py is critical to handle it.

Type Hints: Ensure that all types are imported correctly.

Next Steps: Step-by-Step Development Guide (Focus: Solidifying v0.0)

These steps focus on solidifying the foundation. We're aiming for a fully tested and robust core before adding new features.

Step 1: Comprehensive Backend Testing

Goal: Thoroughly test the existing API endpoints and database interactions. This is the single most important next step.

Tasks:

Refine conftest.py:

Test Database: Crucially, ensure you're using a separate test database. Add a TEST_DATABASE_URL to your .env.example and config.py. In conftest.py, override settings.DATABASE_URL with settings.TEST_DATABASE_URL during tests. This prevents your tests from messing with your development data. This is critical.

Database Fixtures: You have the setup_database and db_session fixtures. Verify they correctly create and drop tables before/after each test function. This ensures test isolation.

Example conftest.py (Adapt to your needs):

# src/backend/tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from src.backend.main import app  # Import your FastAPI app
from src.backend.core.config import settings
from src.backend.core.database import Base, get_db
from src.backend.models.project import Project  # Import your models
from src.backend.models.asset import Asset

# Use a separate test database
TEST_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/test_dbname"  #CHANGE
test_engine = create_async_engine(TEST_DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
TestSessionLocal = sessionmaker(
    bind=test_engine, expire_on_commit=False, class_=AsyncSession
)

# Fixture to create and drop tables before/after each test
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def setup_database():
    async with test_engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
    yield
    async with test_engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.drop_all)

# Fixture for database session
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def db_session():
    async with TestSessionLocal() as session:
        yield session

# Fixture for httpx AsyncClient (for making requests to your API)
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def client():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as c:
        yield c

@pytest.fixture(scope="function", autouse=True)
def override_settings(db_session):
    async def override_get_db():
        yield db_session

    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db
    #Import settings and override database url
    settings.DATABASE_URL = TEST_DATABASE_URL
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Write Test Cases (test_projects.py):

Create a file src/backend/tests/test_api/test_projects.py.

Use pytest.mark.asyncio for your async test functions.

Use the client fixture to make requests to your API.

Use the db_session fixture to interact with the database directly (e.g., to verify data was saved correctly).

Test POST /projects:

Success Case: Send valid data. Assert status code 200, check the response body (project ID), and also query the database directly to ensure the project was created.

Missing Topic: Send a request with a missing topic. Assert status code 422.

Invalid Topic Type: Send a request with, say, a number for the topic. Assert status code 422.

Test GET /projects/{project_id}/status:

Valid ID: Create a project, then get its status. Assert status code 200, check the response body.

Invalid ID: Use a non-existent UUID. Assert status code 404.

Invalid ID Format: Use a string that's not a valid UUID. Assert status code 422 (FastAPI should handle this automatically).

Test GET /projects/{project_id}:

Valid ID: Create a project, then get it by ID. Assert status code 200 and that the returned data matches.

Invalid ID: Use a non-existent UUID. Assert status code 404.

Example Test File (test_projects.py):

# src/backend/tests/test_api/test_projects.py
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient
from src.backend.schemas.project import ProjectCreate

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_project(client: AsyncClient, setup_database):  # Use fixtures
    data = ProjectCreate(topic="Test Topic", notes="Test Notes").model_dump()
    response = await client.post("/projects/", json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    project = response.json()
    assert project["topic"] == "Test Topic"
    assert project["notes"] == "Test Notes"
    assert project["status"] == "CREATED"
    assert "id" in project  # Check for UUID


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_project_status(client: AsyncClient, setup_database):
    # First, create a project
    create_data = ProjectCreate(topic="Test Topic", notes="Test Notes").model_dump()
    create_response = await client.post("/projects/", json=create_data)
    assert create_response.status_code == 200
    project_id = create_response.json()["id"]

    # Now, get its status
    status_response = await client.get(f"/projects/{project_id}/status")
    assert status_response.status_code == 200
    status = status_response.json()
    assert status["status"] == "CREATED"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_project_status_not_found(client: AsyncClient, setup_database):
    response = await client.get(f"/projects/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee/status")  # Invalid UUID
    assert response.status_code == 404
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Project not found"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_list_projects(client: AsyncClient, setup_database):
    # Add a project.
    project_data = ProjectCreate(topic='test_topic', notes='test_notes')
    response = await client.post("/projects/", json=project_data.model_dump())
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # list projects
    response = await client.get('/projects/')
    result = response.json()
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert type(result) == list
    assert len(result) >= 1

Python

Run Tests: From the root of your project:

docker-compose run api pytest
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Fix any failing tests. This is an iterative process.

Key Improvements: The provided test file includes comprehensive tests covering success and failure cases, using fixtures for setup and teardown. It demonstrates direct database checks and API request testing.

Step 2: Enhanced Error Handling (Backend)

Goal: Implement robust error handling, especially for database operations.

Tasks:

projects.py (API Endpoints):

Wrap database interactions (add, commit, refresh, get) within try...except blocks.

Catch sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError (for unique constraint violations, if you add any).

Catch sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError (for connection problems).

Catch a generic Exception for unexpected errors.

In each except block:

Log the error with as much context as possible (including the exception message and any relevant data like the project topic). Use logger.error().

Raise an appropriate HTTPException with a descriptive detail message. Use appropriate status codes (e.g., 500 for internal errors, 400 for client errors, 409 for conflicts).

Example (in create_project):

@router.post("/", response_model=ProjectSchema)
async def create_project(
    project_create: ProjectCreate, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    logger.info(f"Creating project with topic: {project_create.topic}")
    try:
        project = Project(**project_create.model_dump())
        db.add(project)
        await db.commit()
        await db.refresh(project)
        return project
    except IntegrityError as e:
        await db.rollback()
        logger.error(f"Integrity error creating project: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=409, detail="Project with this topic already exists")  # Example: Assuming a unique constraint
    except OperationalError as e:
        await db.rollback()
        logger.error(f"Database operational error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Database error")
    except Exception as e:
        await db.rollback() # Rollback the transaction
        logger.error(f"Error creating project: {e}", exc_info=True) # Log with stack trace
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Repeat similar error handling in get_project_status and any other API endpoints you add.

Test Error Cases: Add tests to your test_projects.py that specifically trigger these error conditions (e.g., try to create a project with a duplicate topic if you have a unique constraint). Assert that the correct HTTP status codes and error messages are returned.

Step 3: Celery Configuration and a Basic Task

Goal: Get Celery properly configured and running a simple test task.

Tasks:

Update celeryconfig.py:

Use the settings from your src/backend/core/config.py file. This makes your configuration consistent and easier to manage.

# src/backend/celeryconfig.py
from src.backend.core.config import settings # Import your settings

broker_url = settings.CELERY_BROKER_URL  # Use settings
result_backend = settings.CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND  # Use settings
broker_connection_retry_on_startup = True  # Add this to handle the deprecation warning
broker_connection_retry = True # Keep existing behavior
task_serializer = 'json'
result_serializer = 'json'
accept_content = ['json']
enable_utc = True

worker_prefetch_multiplier = 1 #Prevent worker from prefetching multiple tasks
worker_max_tasks_per_child = 10 #Restart worker after 10 tasks to prevent memory leaks

task_always_eager = False  # VERY IMPORTANT: Set to False for production
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Update src/backend/tasks/project_tasks.py:

Make sure to use the configuration in the celeryconfig.py file.

from celery import Celery
from ..core.config import settings # Import your settings

celery = Celery('project_tasks',
                broker=settings.CELERY_BROKER_URL,
                backend=settings.CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND)
# No need to call config_from_object if using the broker/backend directly
# celery.config_from_object('src.backend.celeryconfig')

@celery.task(name='test_task')
def test_task(x, y):
    return x + y
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Test Celery (Basic):

Create a test file: src/backend/tests/test_tasks/test_project_tasks.py.

Use pytest.mark.celery to indicate tests requiring Celery.

Use the celery_app fixture. This requires a celery_config fixture in your conftest.py:

# src/backend/tests/conftest.py
# ... (previous fixtures) ...

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def celery_config():
    return {
        'broker_url': 'memory://',  # Use in-memory broker for testing
        'result_backend': 'rpc://',
        'task_always_eager': True,  # Run tasks synchronously
        'task_eager_propagates': True,
    }
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Call your test_task using .delay() and assert the result. Example:

# src/backend/tests/test_tasks/test_project_tasks.py
import pytest
from src.backend.tasks.project_tasks import celery, test_task

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def celery_config():
    return {
        'broker_url': 'memory://',  # Use in-memory broker for testing
        'result_backend': 'rpc://', #Use RPC result backend for testing.
        'task_always_eager': True,  # Run tasks synchronously
        'task_eager_propagates': True,
    }

@pytest.mark.celery
def test_test_task(celery_app):
    result = test_task.delay(2, 3)
    assert result.get() == 5
    assert result.successful()
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Run Celery Tests:

docker-compose run api pytest src/backend/tests/test_tasks
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Step 4: Structured Logging (Backend)

Goal: Switch to JSON logging for easier parsing and analysis (especially with tools like Loki).

Tasks:

Install python-json-logger: Add python-json-logger to your src/backend/requirements.txt.

Configure Logging (in src/backend/main.py):

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from src.backend.api.routers import projects
from src.backend.core.config import settings
from src.backend.core.database import engine
from src.backend.models.project import Base  # Import your base model
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
import logging
import json
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger

# Initialize Prometheus instrumentator first
instrumentator = Instrumentator()

# Create FastAPI app
app = FastAPI(
    title=settings.PROJECT_NAME,
    version=settings.API_VERSION
)

# Instrument the app with Prometheus metrics before any other middleware
instrumentator.instrument(app).expose(app)

# Configure CORS - Allow any origin in development, adjust for production
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # In production, replace with specific domains
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Include routers
app.include_router(projects.router)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Create database tables
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
    logger.info("Database tables created")

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "OK"}

# --- JSON Logging Setup ---
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

logHandler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s')
logHandler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(logHandler)
# --- End JSON Logging Setup ---
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Use the Logger: Use logger.info(), logger.warning(), logger.error(), logger.debug() throughout your backend code. Include relevant context in your log messages.

Example:

logger.info("Project created", extra={"project_id": str(project.id), "topic": project.topic})
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Step 5: Review Asynchronous Code

Goal: Make absolutely sure all database interactions, and any potentially long-running operations use async/await properly.

Tasks:

Database Operations: All functions interacting with the database (using db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)) must be async def and use await for database operations (e.g., await db.add(project), await db.commit(), await db.get(...)).

API Calls (Future): When you start making calls to external APIs (like HeyGen), those functions must also be async def and use await with an async HTTP client like httpx.

Celery Tasks: Celery tasks by default should be non async.

Code Review: Carefully review all your backend code. Use pylint with the asyncio plugin:

pip install pylint asyncio  #If you do not have this installed locally.
pylint --load-plugins=pylint_asyncio src/backend
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Run Tests: Run all tests again to verify that async is being used properly.

Step 6: Confirm Frontend API Connection and Env Variables

Goal: Verify that frontend and backend can communicate correctly and test the changes.

Tasks:

Frontend API URL Configuration (Review):

Check your src/frontend/lib/api.ts file. The getApiUrl() is present.

const getApiUrl = () => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
    // Server-side (Next.js API routes, etc.) - use the environment variable
    return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
  } else {
    // Client-side - assume same origin (works if frontend is served from Next.js dev server)
    return ''; //  Empty string uses the current origin
  }
};
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
TypeScript

Add Proxy Configuration (Review):

Add the proxy configuration to next.config.js.

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  async rewrites() { // Add this rewrites configuration
    return [
      {
        source: '/projects/:path*',
        destination: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/projects/:path*`,
      },
      {
        source: '/health',
        destination: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/health`,
      },
    ];
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
JavaScript

Run Frontend and Backend: Start both applications. Make a request from the frontend (e.g., create a project). Verify that:

The request reaches the backend (check logs).

The database is updated correctly.

The frontend receives the expected response.

The application functions without errors.

The server is running on the M2 Max.

The client is running on the M2 Pro and also on the M2 Max.

Step 7: Verify and Test Docker Compose Setup

Goal: Confirm that the Docker Compose setup works correctly, including networking between containers.

Tasks:

Environment Variables: Double-check that all necessary environment variables (database URL, Redis URL, API URL, Clerk keys) are correctly defined in your .env file and are being passed to the containers in your docker-compose.yml. Never hardcode secrets directly in your code or Dockerfiles.

Networking: Ensure that the api, celery_worker, postgres, and redis services are all on the same Docker network (content-platform in your docker-compose.yml). This allows them to communicate using service names as hostnames (e.g., postgres:5432).

Ports: Verify that the ports are correctly mapped. For example, your API is exposed on port 8000. Your frontend is on port 3000.

Healthchecks: Your healthchecks in the docker-compose.yml are a great start, but they become more useful once we have more substantial logic.

Build and Run:

docker-compose up --build
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

This rebuilds the images (important if you've made code changes) and starts all services.

Test: Create a project using the frontend, and verify that all services are functioning together as expected. Check the logs of all containers (docker-compose logs).

Step 8: Check Model Relationship

Goal: Ensure correct setup of project and asset model relationships.

Tasks:

Project Model (Review):

Review model in src/backend/models/project.py

from sqlalchemy import Column, String, DateTime, Enum as SQLEnum
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Project(Base):
    __tablename__ = "projects"

    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    name = Column(String, nullable=True)  # Name can be null initially
    status = Column(SQLEnum("CREATED", "PROCESSING", "COMPLETED", "ERROR", name="project_status"))
    topic = Column(String, nullable=False)
    notes = Column(String, nullable=True)  # Adding notes field
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)

    # Define relationship with proper cascade
    assets = relationship("Asset", back_populates="project", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Asset Model (Review):

Review model in src/backend/models/asset.py

from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Boolean, DateTime, ForeignKey, Enum as SQLEnum
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from .project import Base

class Asset(Base):
    __tablename__ = "assets"

    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    project_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("projects.id"))
    asset_type = Column(SQLEnum("script", "narration", "video", "image", "slide", name="asset_type"))
    path = Column(String, nullable=False)
    approved = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)

    # Relationship
    project = relationship("Project", back_populates="assets")
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

Step 9: Linting (Optional but Recommended)

Goal: Enforce a consistent coding style and catch potential errors early.

Tasks:

Install Linters:

docker-compose run api pip install black isort flake8 mypy
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Configure Linters: Create configuration files for each linter in your src/backend directory:

.flake8:

[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203, W503
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Ini

pyproject.toml (for Black and isort):

[tool.black]
line-length = 88

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Toml

mypy.ini (optional, for stricter type checking):

[mypy]
python_version = 3.11
check_untyped_defs = True
disallow_any_generics = True
ignore_missing_imports = True  # Set to False once you have types for all dependencies
no_implicit_optional = True
no_implicit_reexport = True
strict_equality = True
warn_redundant_casts = True
warn_unused_configs = True
warn_unused_ignores = True
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Ini

Run Linters: From the root of your project:

docker-compose run api black src/backend
docker-compose run api isort src/backend
docker-compose run api flake8 src/backend
docker-compose run api mypy src/backend # Optional
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Fix any reported issues.

Deliverables for these Steps:

A fully tested backend API with robust error handling.

A working Celery setup with a basic test task.

Structured JSON logging.

Confirmed frontend-backend communication.

Verified Docker Compose configuration.

Passing tests for all backend code.

Correct model relationships

Workflow with Claude 3.5 Sonnet:

Provide Context: Give Claude the relevant file(s) (e.g., test_projects.py, projects.py, conftest.py) and the specific task you're working on.

Ask Specific Questions: Instead of "write tests for this," ask:

"Given this conftest.py, how can I create a fixture to override the database URL for testing?"

"Write a pytest function to test the create_project endpoint, ensuring it handles a missing 'topic' field correctly."

"How can I use try...except blocks in this FastAPI endpoint to handle potential database errors and return appropriate HTTP responses?"

"How can I adapt the provided code to ensure consistency with an asynchronous approach?"

Review and Understand: Do not blindly copy and paste code. Understand what Claude is suggesting. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

Iterate: Run tests frequently. If a test fails, give Claude the error message and the relevant code. Ask it to help you debug.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): You can also give TDD a try, now that you have some basic familiarity.

This structured approach, combined with Claude's assistance, will help you build a solid foundation for your content platform. Remember to commit your changes frequently and use descriptive commit messages. Once you complete these steps, report back, and we'll plan the next iteration!
